# DRpy

**D**ual-frequency precipitation **R**adar **PY**thon package

This package was made to open [NASA GPM-DPR](https://pmm.nasa.gov/gpm/flight-project/dpr) files. The current flavor of GPM-DPR files is hdf5, which can be opened redily in h5py but lack the convience of built in functionality that xarray has.
